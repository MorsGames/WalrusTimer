# WalrusTimer

**WalrusTimer** is a replacement for GameMaker's built-in alarms. Instead of relying on separate actions, with this script you can just use your own methods, meaning you can declare timers and what they do in a single script, or even a single line if you so choose!

It comes with 6 methods.
- timer_set
- timer_destroy
- timer_get
- timer_system_init
- timer_system_update
- timer_system_room_end

It's only tested on Windows, and currently has some issues with HTML5, issues I can't seem to pinpoint. It also comes with an example project that will teach you the basics.
